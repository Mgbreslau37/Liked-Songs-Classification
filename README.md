# Liked-Songs-Classification
Using Spotify's API, this code sorts all "liked songs" into a user's playlists based on similiraities of energy, danceability, and more.

## Description
I love finding new music on Spotify, however placing a song into one of my many playlists quickly can be a challenge. Often I "like" the song so I can sort it later, though it is easy to forget about allowing my "liked songs" playlist to accumulate with hundreds of dissimilar tracks. In addition, nearly everyone I spoke to has hundreds if not thousands of songs lost in this nonsensical playlist. Using data analysis and ML in Python, this code is meant to take the large assortment of "liked songs" and place them into a playlist based on similarities of energy, danceability, and so on to create a better listening experience.

## Next Steps
While this project was largely a success, there was some inaccuracy due to the similarities of the playlists. Using stronger ML algorithms in addition to more detailed data, I beleive the accuracy will increase tremendously. Furthermore, I hope to create a web application that will allow users to use their own playlists in sorting their liked songs.
