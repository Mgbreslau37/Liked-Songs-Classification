# Liked-Songs-Classification
Using Spotify's API, this code sorts all "liked songs" into a user's playlists based on similiraities of energy, danceability, and more.

## Description
I love finding new music on Spotify, however placing the song into one of my many playlists can be a challenge. Often I "like" the song so I can place the song later, though I  let the song sit in the "liked songs" playlist leaving me with hundreds of dissimilar songs in the collection. In addition, nearly everyone I spoke to has hundreds if not thousands of songs lost in this nonsensical playlist. This code is meant to take the large assortment of "liked songs" and place them into a playlist based on similarities of energy, danceability, and so on.

## Next Steps
While this project was largely a success, there was some inaccuracy due to the similarities of the playlists. Using stronger ML algorithms in addition to more detailed data, I beleive the accuracy will increase tremendously. Furthermore, I hope to create a web application that will allow users to use their own playlists in sorting their liked songs.
